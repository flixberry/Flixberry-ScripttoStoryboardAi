## 🧩 Problem Solved  

Turning written stories into visual structure can be challenging without artists or expensive tools.  
Flixberry Script to Storyboard AI bridges that gap by generating **panel-style breakdowns** from your script, helping you visualize pacing, dialogue, and flow even before any art is created.

## 🛠️ Built With  

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Platform:** Chrome Canary (Prompt API preview)  
- **Architecture:** Frontend-only, privacy-first  
- **APIs:** Scaffolded for Chrome’s Prompt API  
- **Hosting:** [flixberry.com/scripttostoryboardai](https://www.flixberry.com/scripttostoryboardai)

## 🧠 API Readiness Note  

This project is designed for Chrome’s **Prompt API powered by Gemini Nano**.  
Since the API is still in early access, the current version uses **text-only panels** instead of generated images.  

Once Chrome exposes the API publicly, Flixberry Script to Storyboard AI will automatically support **AI generated visual storyboards**, bringing your script scenes to life with imagery.

## 📚 Project Story  

### Inspiration  
This project was inspired by the creative process of turning words into motion. Writers often struggle to see how their stories might look as films or comics. I wanted to make that transformation simple, fast, and accessible, especially for solo creators and small teams.  

### What it does  
Flixberry Script to Storyboard AI reads your story and turns it into **structured storyboard panels** that capture scenes, dialogue, and pacing — like reading a film in text form.  

### How it was built  
Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the app runs entirely in Chrome and is scaffolded for future integration with the Prompt API. The frontend only structure ensures full privacy and zero data transfer.  

### Challenges  
Designing an engaging storyboard layout **without visuals** required creativity. The absence of the Prompt API made testing and structure parsing unpredictable — but it led to a strong text-based storytelling foundation ready for AI image generation later.  

### Accomplishments  
Built a working prototype that instantly turns text scripts into organized panels. It’s intuitive, fast, and ready to evolve into a full AI powered storyboard tool when Chrome’s API becomes widely available.  

### What’s next  
Future updates include **AI generated visual panels**, export options (PDF/storyboard sheets), and integration with **Flixberry CharacterView AI** for a complete creative pipeline.
